				<p className="post-text">
					I am Didier Bidaux, a self-taught developer, former biologist and former automotive electronics technician, careers that I put aside to pursue my passion, which are computers, and any kind of technology.
					<br />
					<br />

					I started my programming path at university, thanks to the professor of Computer Science and Statistics, with Python (plotly, matplotlib). When I finished the degree in Biology, and seeing that the job market was turning towards a future dominated by technology, I decided to focus on this path.
					<br />
					<br />
					I'm more oriented towards development than data modeling (that I did at university), but I really enjoy the data processing.
					<br />
					<br />
					I decided to start learning Javascript, for the frontend, since with Python I had the backend covered (Django/Flask). I started with vanilla JS, but quickly moved on to using React, since it is a library that simplifies the development process (currently learning Angular) .
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I have also used Node.JS for the backend, and I usually pivot between the two languages â€‹â€‹for the backend.

					I have to say goodbye, the next project is calling me!
