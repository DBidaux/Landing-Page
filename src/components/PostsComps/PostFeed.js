						It is deployed on a Raspberry5 VPS, fully dockerized.

						You can sign up and try it out, so you can give me feedback!

						I included it in my portfolio, since despite being a personal project, it arose from the need to plan events and purchases in common, since it was becoming quite complicated as the group of friends grew.
